# COVID-19-DATA-ANALYSIS
ANALYSIS OF SPREAD OF THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS SPREAD IN DECEMBER 19
THE DATA SET I USED IS SCRAPPED FROM A WELL KNOWN WEBSITE "www.worldometer.com"
MADE USE OF LIBRARIES SUCH AS PLOTLY,MALTPLOTLIB AND FOLIUM.PLOTLY CAN BE USED TO CREATE INTERACTIVE GRAPHS AND PLOTS.

IMPLEMENTED THE TIME SERIES FORCASTING FOR VISUALIZING THE SPREAD OF COVID FROM 15TH MARCH TO 12MAY

THE PLOTS PLOTTED BY PLOTLY ARE NOT VISIBLE IN THE NOTEBOOK. SO I HAVE PROVIDED AN HTML FILE. DOWNLOAD IT AND OPEN IT USING CHROME
